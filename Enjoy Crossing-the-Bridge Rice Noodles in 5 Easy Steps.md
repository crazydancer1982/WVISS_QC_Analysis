## 🍜 Enjoy Crossing-the-Bridge Rice Noodles in 5 Easy Steps

Dear friends, let me show you **five simple steps** to enjoy the famous Crossing-the-Bridge rice noodles. Get ready!

### Step 1: The Steaming-Hot Soup Base

First, you'll receive a big bowl of **steaming hot chicken soup**. This soup is the heart of the dish! **Be careful, though**: the bowl is extremely hot! **Remember this tip:** don't touch the rim of the bowl!

### Step 2: Cook the Raw Meat

Next, carefully put the thin slices of **raw meat** into the soup. You only need to wait about five seconds. When the meat **turns white**, it means it’s perfectly cooked and ready to eat!

### Step 3: Add the Greens

Then, it's time to add the fresh **veggies**. Start by dropping in the **bean sprouts**, and then add the other green leaves. This makes the noodles healthy and flavorful.

### Step 4: Drop in the Rice Noodles

After that, gently place the soft **rice noodles** into the bowl. Make sure to push them down into the soup for about three seconds so they can absorb all the flavor.

### Step 5: Mix and Enjoy!

Finally, use your chopsticks to **mix everything together**. Take a bite of your noodles to check the flavor. If you like spicy food, you can add some chili oil.
